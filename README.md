# discord-rpc
This repository is a default RPC for Discord, wrote on Java

But you're need to config that RPC.

# configuration
1st step: download source code and put it in any folder. (e.g.: Desktop/discord-rpc)

2nd step: open Eclipse and switch workspace to that folder.

3rd step: edit .java classes to you. (I put some description in classes)

# done
Launch in Eclipse/export it and launch your RPC and its done.
